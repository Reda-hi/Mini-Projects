# 🚀 Mini Projects Repository

Welcome to my digital playground! 🌟

This repository is a curated collection of my journey through the realms of **Cybersecurity**, **Cloud Computing**, and **Programming**. Here, I document my learning process, experiments, and the projects I build along the way.

## 🎯 Mission
To bridge the gap between theory and practice by building hands-on projects that explore:
- 🛡️ **Cybersecurity**: Understanding defenses and security mechanisms.
- ☁️ **Cloud Computing**: Exploring cloud infrastructure and architectures.
- 💻 **Programming**: Solving problems and building applications.

## 📂 Projects Showcase

Here are the projects I've built, spanning Cybersecurity, Cloud, and Programming:

- 🛡️ **Python Port Scanner**
    - A command-line tool to scan open ports on a target IP.
    - **Features**: Custom port ranges (`--start`, `--end`), live progress updates, and a summary table of open ports.
    - **Usage**: `python Port_Scanner.py <IP> [--start <start_port>] [--end <end_port>]`
    - *Note: Start and End are optional (Default range: 1-1024)*

- 💧 **LeekSeeker (Breach Data Search)**
    - A specialized tool to search for compromised credentials in large breach files without crashing memory.
    - **Features**: Multi-domain search (`@gmail.com|@yahoo.com`), automatic result sorting by domain, and optional output file logging.
    - **Usage**: `python LeekSeeker.py "<domains>" <file> [-o <output_file>]`

- *(More projects coming soon!)*
